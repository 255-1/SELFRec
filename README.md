**SELFRec** is a Python framework for self-supervised recommendation (SSR) which integrates commonly used datasets and metrics, and implements 10+ state-of-the-art SSR models. SELFRec has a lightweight architecture and provides user-friendly interfaces. It can facilitate model implementation and evaluation.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Fast execution</b>: SELFRec is developed with Python 3.7+, Tensorflow 1.14+ and Pytorch 1.7+. All models run on GPUs. Particularly, we optimize the time-consuming procedure of item ranking, drastically reducing the ranking time to seconds (less than 10 seconds for the scale of 10,000Ã—50,000). </li>
<li><b>Easy configuration</b>: SELFRec provides a set of simple and high-level interfaces, by which new SSR models can be easily added in a plug-and-play fashion.</li>
<li><b>Highly Modularized</b>: SELFRec is divided into multiple discrete and independent modules/layers. This design decouples the model design from other procedures. For users of SELFRec, they just need to focus on the logic of their method, which streamlines the development.</li>
<li><b>SSR-Specific</b>: SELFRec is designed for SSR. For the data augmentation, there is a specific module that have implemented a number of model-agnostic approaches. For different SSR paradigms, SELFRec provides specific base classes and interfaces for rapid development.</li>
</ul>

Version 1.0 coming soon...
